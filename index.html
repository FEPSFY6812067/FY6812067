    <pre>
      This paper provides an overview of robotic surgery, following its evolution from the initial robotic surgical arm
    in the mid-1980s to the sophisticated 'da VinciTM' system widely used today. Key turning points are included in the
    historical course such as the PUMA 560, AESOP 1000, and ZEUS,leading up to the FDA-certified da Vinci in 2000. It will
    also explore and discuss the different parts that the da Vinci surgical systems consists of and the way they work together 
    to operate on the patient with the help of the surgeon. Furthermore, the advantages of robotic surgery, such as precision,
    enhanced visualization, and quicker recovery, are highlighted, alongside disadvantages like high costs, technical 
    malfunctions, and limited accessibility.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        
        Robotic surgery or otherwise called robot-assisted surgery is a kind of minimally invasive surgery where doctors
    can execute complex surgeries with the help of robotic devices. This technology was first developed in the mid 1980s,
    with its first use being the performance of a biopsy in 1985 ‘<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1356187/\">(Lanfranco et al., 2004)</a>’.Since then, this technology
    has developed into a more sophisticated and versatile version of itself for numerous different surgical procedures. 
    The aim of this technology is to improve surgical procedures and the outcomes for the patients. It improves precision,
    flexibility, and control during the operations and gives them a greater view of the site compared with the traditional
    technique. Currently, there is more than one robotic surgical system however, the most know specialized suite of technologies
    is called the ‘da VinciTM’ .

  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
         Victor Scheinmann created the PUMA 560 in 1978 while he was employed at Unimation. The PUMA 560 was the first surgical
    robot employed and was used to guide a needle for a brain biopsy during a neurological procedure. By offering more precise
    and stable direction than a human hand, the PUMA 560 paved the way for upcoming surgical robots. The FDA authorized the 
    Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning 1000, (AESOP 1000) in 1994, marking the next significant advancement in
    robotic surgery‘<a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/rcbc/a/4qVcw3NC75jwPNtkgkhwSWf/">(Morrell et al., 2021)</a>’.It was the first device to hold a laparoscopic camera. NASA financed Computer Motion to 
    develop a robotic arm for use in space travel, however the arm ended up being employed in surgery as a tabletop laparoscopic camera holder.
    With the AESOP 2000 in 1996 and the AESOP 3000 in 1998, later iterations of the robot gained voice control and  seven degrees of freedom 
    to resemble a human hand. One more breakthrough of robotic surgery was when ZEUS brought the concept of telerobotics to robotic surgery
    when it became commercially accessible in 1998. Tn this telepresence surgical system the surgeon sits on a console that is separated 
    from the robot that performs on the patient. The ZEUS robot had three arms, each of which was individually attached to the surgical table.
    Finally, the da Vinci became the first operational surgical robot in the United States when it received FDA certification in 2000 for use 
    in general laparoscopic surgeries ‘<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11701-010-0202-2">(Kalan et al., 2010)</a>’.

     The da Vinci surgical system includes several parts of high intelligence technology. There are 3 main parts of this 
    system (Figure 1). The first is the vision carts which contains of the dual 3-chip camera and a dual light source. 
    The second, which is the master console where the surgeon is positioned.  The third and final one is the transportable 
    cart where the camera arm and the 2 instrument arms‘<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1356187/\">(Lanfranco et al., 2004)</a>’.

  <h3 id="How it works">How it works</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
    
	    Robotic surgeries work with the use of advanced software and specialised robotic gear. The robotic team and the surgeon 
    work together to position the robot, the ‘da Vinci system’, at the most ideal place for the procedure. The surgeon observes
    the patient from a specially designed console during the robotic surgery near the surgical team. A tiny incision is made on 
    the patient so a small 3D camera and dime-sized surgical instruments can be placed inside them. Through the camera the surgeon 
    has a magnified 360 degree-view of the operative field‘<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9573327/">(Bramhe & Pathak, 2022)</a>’.When everything has been placed the surgeon
    starts operating on the patients by using the foot controls and the console’s hand to control and move the robotic arms which are
    attached to the surgical instruments. During the surgery, the surgeon’s team and the surgical technicians are close to the operating 
    table to make sure the placement of the surgical system is correct and that everything works smoothly.

  <h3 id="Advantages and Disadvantages">Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Robotic surgery is a medical innovation which offers both advantages and disadvantages. Robotic systems can make precise
    movements, which is crucial for all procedures especially for the more delicate ones. Moreover, the use of robotic systems 
    enhances the visualisation of the operative field, as a surgeon has access to a 3D camera system which offers an enlarged,
    image of the surgery site for more accurate detailed work. One more advantage of this technology is that the surgeons may 
    conduct longer and more intricate surgeries with less fatigue because of the ergonomic design of the console, which lessens
    physical pressure that they are required to undergo. Lastly, this type of surgery enables faster recovery for the patient,
    which leads to shorter hospital stays and allows them to resume daily activities faster. On the other hand, there are some
    disadvantages associated with a robotic surgery such as the cost. Robotic surgical systems have a high initial cost, and 
    continuing maintenance and training can be costly to both the hospital and the patients. Furthermore, this type of surgery 
    depends mostly on technology which sometimes can be unfortunate. It is possible that during a robotic-assisted surgery a 
    technical malfunction can occur in components of the system such as the camera, robotic tower, robotic arms, etc. which can
    terminate the surgery and harm the patient.  Moreover, certain patients may not have access to robotic surgery systems because 
    not all hospitals have them and not all surgeons have the appropriate training for it. In addition, robotic surgery doesn’t 
    work for every type of surgery, in a very precise or highly specialized procedures may have to be performed by traditional 
    method‘<a href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/web-mm/robotic-surgery-risks-vs-rewards">(Kirkpatrick & LaGrange, 2016)</a>’. In conclusion, robotic surgery is an advanced technology which has it benefits and 
    its risk.

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
	<pre>
	To sum up everything that has been stated so for, since its start in the mid-1970s robotic-assisted surgery-embodied by
   the da Vinci system, has seen a remarkable progress. It has evolved from the PUMA 560, which was a ground-breaking device, to 
   the sophisticated da Vinci, and is now an essential part of many surgical operations. The da Vinci system’s three main parts, 
   coupled with the advanced software, empower surgeons with control and increased precision. While its benefits include more accurate 
   motions, better visualization, and quicker patient recovery, drawbacks including expensive initial expenditures, glitches in 
   technology, and restricted accessibility highlight the need for cautious thought. In the constantly changing field of medical
   technology, finding a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of robotic surgery is crucial to guaranteeing the best 
   possible outcomes for patients.
